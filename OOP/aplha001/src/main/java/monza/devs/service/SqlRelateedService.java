            - `id` (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
            - `name` (VARCHAR): The name of the employee
            - `department` (VARCHAR): The department the employee belongs to
            - `join_date` (DATE): The date the employee joined the company
            - `salary` (INT): The employee's annual salary in USD
            - `age` (INT): The age of the employee in years
            - `gender` (VARCHAR): The gender of the employee (e.g., Male/Female/Other)
            - `nationality` (VARCHAR): The nationality of the employee
            - `canteen_money` (INT): The amount of money allocated for the employee's canteen expenses
            - `average_work_time` (INT): The average time (in years) employees have worked in the company
            - `location` (VARCHAR): The location of the employee (e.g., Koramangala, Indiranagar, Whitefield)
            - `phone_number` (VARCHAR): The phone number of the employee
            Generate a valid SINGLE LINE SQL query based on the following natural language request
            and just say the sql query without any explanation or additional text:
            dont display their age, joindate, age, gender, nationality, canteen_money unless the user explicitly asks for more columns.
            Try to always list the employee name and in the select statement.
            If the user requests to add money or get a hike in total salary, calculate the updated salary dynamically in the query but do not persist it in the database.
            Make sure the Sql statement is in one line without any newlines or line breaks.
            Just say the SQL query without any explanation or additional text.
            SELECT name, department, salary FROM employees WHERE average_work_time < 2 AND id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2);
            If the user asks for people from a particular location, include the `location` column in the SELECT statement and filter the results based on the specified location. For example:

            SELECT name, department, salary, location FROM employees WHERE location = 'Koramangala';
